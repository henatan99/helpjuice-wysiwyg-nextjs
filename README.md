## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The app lets users to write in a text editor with wysiwyg approach. 

There is a text input area where users can type their text. Initially it has empty content and has a default styling. When the user starts writing on it the app starts to save each input change on a local state and conditionally saves the input value.

- Making a heading tag

  Users can make a heading tag by typying `/1` at the beginning. Then a modal pops up to let the user pick options like `Heading 1` and `Extended Heading 1`. The style will automatically change to predefined `heading1` style and the input area placholder reads `Heading 1`. Then when the user starts wriiting the style is in `Heading 1`. It is also possible to continue wriiting after the `/1` tag which ignores the popup modal and changes the styling to `Heading 1`. The `Heading 1` tag also has appropriate `marginBottom` value to give a sufficient space after a `Heading` before a paragraph starts. 

- When the user wants to end the current block just pressing `Enter` key will end the block and saves it to a local state. Each block is saved in a local array of block objects.

- The default text has a predefined `p` style which represents a noremal paragraph text style.
